# WoW-TBC-ARP-Calculator

A simple, yet functional WoW TBC ARP Calculator.
Screenshot of how it looks like: https://i.postimg.cc/dQxZ60Dn/ARP-Calculator.png

This tool allows you to dynamically switch between bosses from most popular TBC dungeons.

You will see their armor value and you will be able to tick the buffs that your raid has and type in your passive ARP values.
As a consecuence, you will see the post-ARP armor of the chosen boss and the amount of dps you lose.

This calculator is supposed to prevent melee nerds from stacking TOO MUCH Armor Penetration. Most bosses in TBC have either 6200 or 7700 armor, which means that under some circumstances you can have so much ARP that boss' armor goes below zero, resulting into some ARP being a worthless stat.

Other than that, IMO it is just an interesting toy to play around with.

If I missed any boss/buff/item/consumable etc - let me know.
Programmers, feel free to punch me in the face for my code - I would love to improve with the help of your advice.
